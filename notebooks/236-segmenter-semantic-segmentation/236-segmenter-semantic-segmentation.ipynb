    "# Semantic Segmentation with OpenVINOâ„¢ using Segmenter\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic segmentation is a difficult computer vision problem with many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, augmented reality, and many others.\n",
    "Its goal is to assign labels to each pixel according to the object it belongs to, creating so-called segmentation masks.\n",
    "To properly assign this label, the model needs to consider the local as well as global context of the image.\n",
    "This is where transformers offer their advantage as they work well in capturing global context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Segmenter is based on Vision Transformer working as an encoder, and Mask Transformer working as a decoder.\n",
    "With this configuration, it achieves good results on different datasets such as ADE20K, Pascal Context, and Cityscapes.\n",
    "It works as shown in the diagram below, by taking the image, splitting it into patches, and then encoding these patches.\n",
    "Mask transformer combines encoded patches with class masks and decodes them into a segmentation map as the output, where each pixel has a label assigned to it.\n",
