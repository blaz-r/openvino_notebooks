# Semantic Segmentation with OpenVINOâ„¢ using Segmenter

This notebook demonstrates how to convert and use [Segmenter](https://github.com/rstrudel/segmenter) PyTorch model 
with OpenVINO.

Semantic segmentation is a difficult computer vision problem with many applications. 
Its goal is to assign labels to each pixel according to object it belongs to, creating so-called segmentation masks.
To properly assign this label, the model needs to consider local as well as global context of image.
This is where transformers offer their advantage as they work well in capturing global context.
Segmenter is based on Vision Transformer working as encoder, and Mask Transformer working as decoder.
With this configuration, it achieves good results on different datasets such as ADE20K, Pascal Context and Cityscapes.
